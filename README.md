# A Depth Map Post-Processing Approach Based on Adaptive Random Walk With Restart
This repository contains the code for the method presented in the following paper:

**H. Javidnia and P. Corcoran, "A Depth Map Post-Processing Approach Based on Adaptive Random Walk With Restart," in *IEEE Access*, vol. 4, pp. 5509-5519, 2016. doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2603220**

The code is written and compiled in MATLAB R2017a x64. The MEX files are also compiled in x64 environment.
To run the code please follow these instructions:

1. Download the repository.
2. Run the "Run.m" file in MATLAB.

There is one sample set of stereo image along with the code. The images are downloded from [Middlebury Stereo becnhmark](http://vision.middlebury.edu/stereo/).

The initial depth map is estimated using the [Adaptive Random Walk with Restart algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0262885615000104).
